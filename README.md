#Steroids Repro Template

Steroids Repro Template is a stripped-down Steroids project for reproducing Steroids issues. Clone it to your computer, create your repro case and put it on GitHub. Let us know about it by creating a new issue on [the Steroids issue tracker](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues) and linking your repro case to the issue (or linking it to an existing issue if you can find one).

## Initialization

Initialize the project by running `steroids update` in the directory.
